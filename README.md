# my_first_binf_pipeline
In progress end-to-end bioinformatic analysis pipeline developed in Nextflow.

---
Now that I am at the end of my bioinformatic training and that I have more experience, I want to attempt to develop an end-to-end bioinformatic analysis pipeline that goes through the standard steps:
- download raw read data from 1KGP of mulitple samples
- quality control and produce a quality control report
- read mapping
- variant calling
- polygenic risk score
- (potentially some in-house analysis)
